  let me know how its going! Pretty terrible right! I know. Been through. Could you imagine i have to hear this 24/7. this mind speaks to me while driving, eating, shower, studing, workout and finally when i rest to sleep.
  it comes up with really weird dreams.
  i need to get control of this.....Anyways

<p>Continuing About me. I am inspired to learn Full Stack Web Development because i want to be skillful and also get a job in tech companies.
  I enrolled in this course back in Jan 2022. But couldn't make myself available because of job and time issues.
  As i mentioned before i have my education in Information Technology but i didn't work in any fields related to it.
  After Graduation i worked in Finance and Ed-Tech Companies as a Sales Rep and now i need a career change.
  I have a huge set of goals for myself. But as of now lets focus on this and squeeze it till it all out of juice......That's what she said!!
